         <p> My name is Vincent Tinaro. I am a freshman applied Mathematics Major at Uri. Unfortunately not everyone loves Math as much as <br>
         me :((. This fact deeply saddens me every day. I am a local Rhode Islander from Warwick. I love to surf down in Narragansett. <br>
         At school I am a part of the Club Rugby team and I enjoy playing smash brothers in the gaming club.
